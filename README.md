# FINANCE_MONEY
The FINANCE MONEY project was created to manage the family budget as part of the Coding Fest hackathon. 

Start-up instructions: 

Open the project in PyCharm (make sure Python is installed on your computer). In the terminal (make sure that the path to the folder where the files are located is written in it) run the command “pip install -r requirements.txt ”, without quotes (installation of necessary dependencies). Run the file main.py.
